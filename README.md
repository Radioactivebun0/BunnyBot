# BunnyBot

A discord bot I made, named after my love for bunnys

Use `!Bb help` for a list of working commands

# NOTES:

In order for the `$ai` command to work, you must have [cakechat](https://github.com/lukalabs/cakechat) running

In order for the music commands to work, you must have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) installed and added to your path

This is meant to run on python 3.8
